# TGR-Ecopath
Journal contribution

This study focused on developing an Ecopath food-web model for Gaoyang Lake—a backwater tributary of China’s Three Gorges Reservoir—incorporating novel components, including multiple producer and microbial groups, as well as mixotrophy. The model was designed to holistically capture the complex energy and cycling pathways in Gaoyang Lake. The food-web model includes data collected from Gaoyang Lake, other studies of the Three Gorges Reservoir, and data from similar species or systems where data were unavailable.

All tables referenced in the main text are included in in Appendix B.
